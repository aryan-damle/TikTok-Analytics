### Error
+ Currently, this project is unavailable due to an bug with playwright (https://playwright.dev/). 
+ Issue: https://github.com/davidteather/TikTok-Api/issues/1012

### Project
This project uses the unoffical TikTokApi by David Teather
+ https://github.com/davidteather/TikTok-Api

+ TikTok Analytics uses the unofficial TikTokApi to read data from the TikTok front-end to find trending videos based on an user inputted hashtag. 
+ The data is analyzed by the Pandas Python library and displayed by plotly.express.
+ Pandas: https://pandas.pydata.org/
+ Plotly Express: https://plotly.com/python/plotly-express/
+ The data is then displayed in the web application by streamlit.
